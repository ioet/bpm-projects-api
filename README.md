### Install

Thanks to the `requirements.txt` we can install the dependencies using

### Usage

Run the project using 

1. For using Flask's development capabilities as the autoloading set this `FLASK_ENV` environment variable
to `development`, i.e.

1. Run the app from your terminal, i.e.

```
python bpm-projects-api/app.py

The use of an IDE is highly recommended, namely PyCharm.
